## Abstract

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of machine learning models that can generate realistic data. In this paper, we explore the use of GANs for generating handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. The model consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, which compete to create realistic images and distinguish real from fake data.

## How to Run the Code

To run the Python code in `gan_model.py`, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can then directly run the following command:

```bash
python gan_model.py
